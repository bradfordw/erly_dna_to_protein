This is actually based on some code I saw a while ago, but can't seem to get my Google keywords straight to find it.

Anyway, usage is as follows:

ok = dna_translate:start_link().

{ok, ProteinSeq} = dna_translate:transcribe(<<"YOUR CHUNK O' DNA">>).

You get back a binary of the protein sequence.

Some notes

I'm curious if it would be faster on longer sequences by nabbing the codons in chunks of three instead of individually. The downside of course is the number of 
functions with the varying patterns would get rather verbose.

Adding streaming would be cool if you need to convert a ton of DNA.
